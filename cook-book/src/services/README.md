# Services

This directory contains service modules that encapsulate business logic and data access operations. Services are designed to interact with external APIs, databases, or other data sources, and provide a clean interface for the rest of the application to use.

## Common Services

Some examples of services that might be included in this directory are:

- **API services:** Functions to interact with external APIs.
- **Database services:** Functions to perform CRUD operations on the database.
- **Authentication services:** Functions to handle user authentication and authorization.
- **Email services: Functions to send emails.
Payment services: Functions to process payments.

## Example Service

Here is an example of a simple service that fetches user data from an external API:

```jsx

// services/user.jsx

import axios from 'axios';

/**
 * Fetches user data from an external API.
 * @param {string} userId - The ID of the user to retrieve.
 * @returns {Promise<object>} - A promise that resolves to the user data.
 */
export const getUserData = async (userId: string): Promise<object> => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Error fetching user data: ${error.message}`);
  }
};

```
