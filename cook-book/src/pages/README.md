# Pages 

The Pages directory contains the main views of the application. Each page is responsible for rendering specific features and components for users to interact with. Pages are usually tied to routes within the application, and they manage the layout of their child components.

## Common Pages

Some examples of pages that might be included in this directory are:

- **Home Page:** The landing page of the application, which may include a brief introduction and call-to-action elements.
- **Login Page:** A page that allows users to log into the system.
- **Signup Page:** A page that allows new users to register an account.
- **Dashboard Page:** The main page users see after logging in, where they can access other features like profile, settings, or data.
- **Profile Page:** A page where users can view and edit their personal information.
Error Page: A page that shows when something goes wrong (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error).

## Example Page
Here is an example of a basic Login Page that uses components and services:

```jsx
// pages/HomePage.jsx
import React from 'react';
import Navbar from '../components/Navbar';
import Button from '../components/Button';

const HomePage = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      <h1>Welcome to the Home Page</h1>
      <Button label="Click Me" onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;

```
